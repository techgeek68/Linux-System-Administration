## Understanding File System Paths

  - A path specifies the unique location of a file or directory within the file system hierarchy.
  - It consists of a sequence of directory names, separated by forward slashes (/).

---

**The Current Working Directory**
  - When you open a terminal, your initial location is typically your home directory.
  - Both users and system processes have a current working directory that can change as needed
  - Displays the absolute path of your current location.
```bash
pwd
```

**Absolute Paths**:
  - An absolute path is a fully qualified name that specifies the exact location of a file starting from the root directory.
  - It always begins with a forward slash (/), which represents the root of the file system.
  - Example: `/var/log/messages`


**Relative Paths**: 
  - A relative path specifies the location of a file or directory relative to the current working directory (the shell's present location).
  - Example: Relative to `/var`, the file `/var/log/messages` is `log/messages`

**Path Characters**

| Character | Meaning           | Example                |
|-----------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| `.`       | Current directory  | `./file.txt`           |
| `..`      | Parent directory   | `../parent/file.txt`   |
| `~`       | Home directory     | `~/Documents/file.txt` |
| `/`       | Root directory     | `/etc/hosts`           |


**Examples**

  - Given this structure:
```
~
├── projects/
│   ├── web/
│   │   └── index.html
│   └── mobile/
│       └── app.java
└── documents/
    └── report.txt
```
```bash
mkdir -p ~/projects/web \
         ~/projects/mobile \
         ~/documents \
&& touch ~/projects/web/index.html \
         ~/projects/mobile/app.java \
         ~/documents/report.txt
```

```bash
cd projects/web/            # Relative path
cd ../../documents/         # Relative Path
cd /home/cnode/projects/mobile/    # Absolute path
cd ../../..                        # Relative path ; Three step back
cd                              
```
