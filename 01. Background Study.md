# Computer Systems: Hardware, Software, and Servers

---

**Computer Hardware & Software**

*   **Computer Hardware** refers to the physical, tangible components of a computer system. These components are manufactured from various materials, including electronic, magnetic, and others. Examples include the CPU, memory (RAM), hard disk drive (HDD), solid state drive (SSD), and motherboard.
*   **Computer Software** is a collection of instructions and data, written in a programming language, that tells the hardware what to do and how to do it. Without software, hardware is inert.



**System Software vs. Application Software**

*   **System Software** is designed to operate and manage the computer hardware itself. It provides a platform for running application software and acts as an intermediary between the user, the applications, and the hardware.
    *   **Examples:** Operating Systems (Windows, Linux, macOS), Device Drivers, Firmware, Utilities.
*   **Application Software** consists of programs designed to help users perform specific tasks. These are installed on top of the system software.
    *   **Examples:** Word Processors (Microsoft Word), Media Players (VLC), Web Browsers (Chrome, Firefox), and graphic design tools.

**Computer (Desktop) vs. Server**

| Feature | Desktop Computer | Server |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Role** | For individual use, running user applications. | To provide services, resources, and data to multiple clients over a network. |
| **Processing** | Typically has a single processor (or a multi-core CPU) for general tasks. | Often has multiple processors (or many-core CPUs) and supports parallel processing for faster access and handling of multiple requests. |
| **Storage & Redundancy** | Usually a single hard drive. If it fails, data is lost. | Often uses multiple hard drives in configurations like RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) to mirror data and prevent loss. |
| **Power Supply** | A single power supply unit. | Often has redundant, hot swappable power supplies to ensure 24/7 uptime. |
| **Security** | Can be vulnerable to viruses and malware if not protected. | Typically has enhanced security features to protect against cyber threats due to its critical role and network exposure. |
| **Cost & Performance** | Hardware is cost-effective for individual users. Has lower processing power, memory, and storage. | Hardware components are often more robust and costly. Designed for higher processing power, larger memory capacity, and vast storage. |
| **Uptime** | Can be switched off without major consequences. | Designed to run continuously; switching off can disrupt services for all dependent clients. |
| **User Support** | Designed for single user or a few concurrent users. | Built to support multiple user logins and process many simultaneous requests efficiently. |
| **Examples** | Personal desktops, laptops, smartphones. | Web servers, file servers, database servers, mail servers. |

**Machine Code vs. Source Code**

*   **Source Code:**
    *   Written by programmers in a high level or low level programming language (e.g., C++, Python, Assembly).
    *   Human-readable and relatively easy to modify.
    *   Must be translated (compiled or interpreted) into machine code before the computer can execute it.
    *   **Example:**
        ```c
        #include <stdio.h>
        int main() {
            printf("Hello, World!");
            return 0;
        }
        ```


*   **Machine Code:**
    *   The binary code (0s and 1s) that a computer's Central Processing Unit (CPU) can execute directly.
    *   It is a low level language, specific to a particular CPU architecture (e.g., x86-64, ARM).
    *   Generated by a compiler from the source code.
    *   **Representation:** `11010110 00111001 11100101...` (a stream of binary instructions).

**Operating System & Kernel**

*   An **Operating System (OS)** is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the hardware.
*   The **Kernel** is the core component of an operating system. It has complete control over everything in the system and operates at the lowest level.
    *   It is responsible for critical tasks like **process management**, **memory management**, **device management (I/O)**, and **system calls**.
    *   **Example:** The Linux kernel is the core used by operating systems like Ubuntu and Android. Other examples include the Windows NT kernel (used in Windows 10/11) and the XNU kernel (used in macOS).



**Simplified OS Architecture**
```
+-----------------------------------+
|  User Processes / Applications    |
+-----------------------------------+
|            Operating System       |
| +-------------------------------+ |
| |             Kernel            | |
| | - Manages Processes           | |
| | - Manages Memory              | |
| | - Handles I/O Devices         | |
| +-------------------------------+ |
+-----------------------------------+
|      Hardware (CPU, RAM, Disk)    |
+-----------------------------------+
```
*   Without an operating system, a user could not run any application programs or access the hardware efficiently.
*   Other popular operating systems include Apple's macOS, Google's Android, and the various distributions of Linux.



**Server Operating System**
  - A **Server Operating System** is a specialized OS designed to be installed and used on server hardware. It is engineered to handle the demands of serving multiple clients over a network, with a focus on stability, security, and scalability.
  - Common Server OS Types

| Windows Server | Linux Servers | Unix & Unix Like |

**Server Platforms Facilitated by a Server OS**
  *   **Web Server:** Hosts websites and serves web pages to clients (e.g., Apache, Nginx, IIS).
  *   **Mail Server:** Handles and stores email for a domain, allowing users to send and receive messages (e.g., Microsoft Exchange, Postfix).
  *   **File Server:** Provides a central, shared location for storing files on a network.
  *   **Database Server:** Hosts a database management system (DBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server, allowing other applications to query and manipulate data.
  *   **Application Server:** Hosts and executes business logic and applications for client computers (e.g., hosting a custom CRM or ERP system).
  *   **Print Server:** Manages one or more printers, accepting print jobs from client computers and sending them to the appropriate printer.
  *   **DNS/DHCP Server:** Provides network services like domain name resolution and dynamic IP address assignment.

**Virtualization**
  - Operating systems can be installed on physical machines or virtual machines (VMs). Virtualization allows multiple OS instances to run on a single physical host.


**Hypervisor Types**
  - A **hypervisor** (or virtual machine monitor) is software that creates and runs virtual machines.

*   **Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare Metal):**
    *   Runs directly on the host's hardware to control it and manage guest operating systems.
    *   More efficient and secure, as it does not run on top of another OS. Used primarily in enterprise data centers.
    *   **Examples:** VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, KVM (Kernel based Virtual Machine), Xen, Proxmox VE.

*   **Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted):**
    *   Runs as an application on a conventional host operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).
    *   Suitable for individual users for development, testing, or running different OS applications on their personal computers.
    *   **Examples:** Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, Parallels Desktop for Mac.

**Installing KVM on Ubuntu:**
   - To install KVM (Kernel based Virtual Machine) on Ubuntu, follow this guide. KVM allows you to create and manage virtual machines natively in Linux.

**Prerequisites**
1. Ensure Your System Supports Virtualization:
> To verify if your CPU supports hardware virtualization (Intel VT-x or AMD-V), run:
   ```bash
   egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
   ```
> If you see a value greater than 0, your CPU supports virtualization.
> If it shows `0`, ensure virtualization is enabled in your system’s BIOS/UEFI.

3. Check Required Packages:  
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

**Steps to Install KVM on Ubuntu**
1. Install Required Packages for KVM:  
> Run the following commands to install KVM and related dependencies:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y qemu qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon virtinst bridge-utils
   ```

2. Enable and Start the `libvirtd` Service:  
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable libvirtd
   sudo systemctl start libvirtd
   ```

3. Add Your User to the `libvirt` and `kvm` Groups:  
> To manage KVM without sudo, add your user to the necessary groups:
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG libvirt,kvm $USER
   ```
   - After this, log out and back in for the group changes to take effect.

4. Verify the Installation:  
   ```bash
   virsh list --all
   ```
   - If KVM is set up properly, you should see a list of virtual machines (empty if none have been created yet).


- Optional Steps: Install `virt-manager` (GUI for Managing VMs):
  - For a graphical interface to manage VMs:
```bash
sudo apt install -y virt-manager
```
You can launch it with:
```bash
virt-manager
```


   - Ensure Bridge/NAT Networking is Set Up
If you need bridge networking, you can configure `netplan` or ensure the default NAT-based network is working using `virsh`:
```bash
virsh net-list --all
```

   - The `default` network should be `active`. If not, enable it:
```bash
virsh net-start default
virsh net-autostart default
```

- Confirm Virtualization Support
  - To ensure everything is ready for virtualization, use:
```bash
kvm-ok
```
   - If your system supports KVM, you’ll see:
```
INFO: /dev/kvm exists
KVM acceleration can be used
```


   - Creating a Virtual Machine
      - Once KVM is installed, you can create a new VM using the `virt-manager` GUI or `virt-install` in the CLI:
```bash
virt-install \
--name test-vm \
--ram 2048 \
--vcpus 2 \
--disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/test-vm.img,size=20 \
--os-type linux \
--os-variant ubuntu20.04 \
--cdrom /path/to/ubuntu.iso
```

**Installing UTM on MacOS**
   - GUI: [Download and Install](https://mac.getutm.app/)
     
   - Terminal:
      - Install Homebrew (if not already installed)
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
   ```bash
   brew update
   ```
   
   - Install UTM Using Homebrew
   ```bash
   brew install --cask utm
   ```
> This downloads UTM, installs it automatically, and moves it to the **/Applications** folder.

   - Verify Installation
   ```bash
   open /Applications/UTM.app
   ```

- Using the `utmctl` Command Line Tool
    - While UTM is primarily a graphical application, it includes a command line tool (`utmctl`) for managing VMs. Follow these steps:
    - Access `utmctl`: The executable is located at
   ```bash
   /Applications/UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl
   ```

  - Create a Symbolic Link
   To use `utmctl` from any location, create a symbolic link:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -sf /Applications/UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl /usr/local/bin/utmctl
   ```

  - Use `utmctl`
     - Once the symbolic link is created, you can type `utmctl` in your Terminal to access the tool and view available commands:
   ```bash
   utmctl
   ```

  - Launching UTM
    - Since UTM is a graphical app, open it via:
      - **Launchpad** or **Finder**,
          OR
    - Terminal command:
  ```
  vi ~/.zshrc 
  ```
   ```bash
   alias utm='open /Applications/UTM.app'
   ```
   ```
   utm
   ```
