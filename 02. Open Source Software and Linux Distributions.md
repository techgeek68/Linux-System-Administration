# Open Source Software and Linux Distributions

---

Historically, most software was distributed under closed source (proprietary) licenses. Users were granted the right to use the machine code but were not allowed to view or modify the source code. Often, the license explicitly forbade reverse engineering.

The open source philosophy, in contrast, asserts that users should have the right to access the source code, modify it, and redistribute it. This philosophy was championed by the **Free Software Foundation (FSF)** in the 1980s, which emphasized the four essential freedoms:

  - The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
  - The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
  - The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
  - The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this, you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

The **Open Source Initiative (OSI)** was founded in 1998 to promote and protect open source software by managing the Open Source Definition and certifying licenses as OSI(Open Source Initiative) approved.

**Open Source Software**

Open source software refers to software whose source code is made freely available to the public under an open source license. This allows users to use, modify, and distribute the software without restrictions. The source code essentially the underlying blueprint of the software can be accessed and altered by programmers to adapt the software to meet specific needs.

Capabilities for Programmers with Source Code Access:
  - Add New Features: Enhance the software by introducing new functionalities.
  - Modify Existing Functionality: Tailor existing features to better suit specific requirements.
  - Fix Bugs: Resolve issues or improve the performance of parts that aren't functioning as intended.

**Open Source Licensing**
  - When considering software, especially in the context of OSS, three components are important:
    
  - **Ownership**:
    - The intellectual property (IP) of the software is typically owned by the original authors or the organization that developed it. However, open source licenses grant certain rights to users.
      
  - **Money Transfer**:
    - Open source software is often available at no cost, but this is not a requirement. Some open source licenses allow for commercial use and distribution, and companies may charge for support, additional features, or warranties.

  - **Licensing**: The license defines what you can and cannot do with the software. There are two main categories of open source licenses:
    - **GNU General Public License (GPL)**: This is a "copyleft" license. Its core principle is that any derivative work or modified version must also be distributed under the same GPL license. This ensures that the software and all its improvements remain free and open, preventing proprietary appropriation without contributing back to the community.
    - Analogy:
      - The GPL is a potluck recipe. The rule is: “You can use this recipe. If you change it or add new ingredients, you must bring your new soup back to the potluck, and you must share your modified recipe with everyone.” This ensures the community recipe book only gets bigger and better for everyone.

    
     - **BSD style Licenses:** These are highly permissive licenses. They allow software to be freely modified, distributed, and even sold as proprietary software without the requirement to open source the changes. This makes BSD licenses "business friendly" and appealing for those seeking flexible, low restriction solutions.
     - Analogy:
       - The BSD license is a recipe from a friend. The rule is: “You can use this recipe. I don’t care what you do with it. You can sell the soup at your own restaurant and keep your new ingredients a secret. Just do me a favor and put a little note on your menu that says, ‘Original soup concept by…’”

**Examples of Open Source Software**

Open source software has revolutionized the technology landscape, with many well known projects widely adopted across industries. Some notable examples include:

  - **Linux**: The core (kernel) of many operating systems, powering servers, desktops, and embedded devices.
  - **Apache HTTP Server**: One of the most popular web server software solutions, crucial for hosting websites.
  - **Mozilla Firefox**: A secure, customizable, and free web browser.
  - **LibreOffice**: A feature rich, open source office suite offering word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, and more.
  - **Git**: A distributed version control system widely used for collaborative software development.


**Is OSS Bug Free?**

No, open source software is not inherently bug free. However, the open source model allows for many eyes to examine the code, which can lead to faster identification and fixing of bugs (a principle known as "Linus's Law": "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"). The quality of OSS varies by project, and it is not immune to vulnerabilities.

**What Existed Before Linux? The Predecessors!**


**1)Life Before Linux?**

**Multics (1960s)**
  - Multics, or "Multiplexed Information and Computing Service," was designed as a multi user system backed by MIT, Bell Labs, and GE(General Electric) Licensing. It introduced concepts like hierarchical filesystems and multi user capabilities. 
  - It inspired its successor, Unix, through lessons learned by Bell Labs engineers [[1]](https://www.computerhope.com/history/unix.htm).

**Unix (1970s)**
  - Developed at Bell Labs in 1969 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie.
  - The groundbreaking shift was rewriting Unix in the C programming language during the early 1970s, making it portable across different hardware.
  - Unix’s design emphasized modularity, reusing small tools, and building pipelines [[2]](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/unix-linux-history).

**BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution)**
  - BSD Unix stemmed from academic work at UC Berkeley and introduced significant improvements, including better networking stacks widely adopted by systems.
  - BSD played a pivotal role but faced legal hurdles because of licensing complexities involving AT&T [[3]](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/linux-from-the-beginning-history-and-evolution/).

**MINIX (1987)**
  - Andrew Tanenbaum created MINIX as an educational tool for learning operating system principles.
  - While publicly accessible for study, it featured restrictive redistribution policies that dissatisfied Linus Torvalds, motivating him to write Linux as a solution [[4]](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/linux/intro/history).

**GNU Project (1983)**
  - Founded by Richard Stallman, this initiative sought to develop a free Unix like OS. GNU contributed fundamental tools like compilers, editors, and system utilities to what eventually became “GNU/Linux.” The GNU Hurd kernel, however, remained incomplete. [[5]](https://www.systemtek.co.uk/2024/12/the-history-of-linux-from-hobby-project-to-global-phenomenon).


**How Linux Started?**

**Timeline of Development**
  - Linus Torvalds, a Finnish student, began writing the Linux kernel in early 1991 due to the limitations of MINIX. 
  - Linux 0.01 was released as an early version on September 17, 1991, and users could run, modify, and explore the source code.
  - Initially released under a restrictive license, Linus re-licensed the kernel under the GNU General Public License (GPL) in 1992, ensuring that Linux and its derivatives would always remain free and open source.
  - By pairing the Linux kernel with the already existing GNU tools, developers achieved a fully functional free operating system commonly known as GNU/Linux.
    - Linux borrowed design principles from Unix, but was written fresh. GNU utilities filled the gap to provide necessary user programs, forming \"GNU/Linux\" collaboratively.


**Major Milestones**
  - **1991**: Linux kernel version 0.01 released. The project quickly garnered global attention through open developer forums.
  - **1993–1995**: First stable Linux distributions emerged (e.g., Slackware, Debian, Red Hat). These simplified installations and broader deployment. [[4]](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/linux/intro/history).
  - **1994**: Kernel version 1.0 marked Linux as a production ready OS.
  - **2005**: Linus debuted Git, a distributed version control system, revolutionising collaborative software development practices. [[7]](https://matrix.senecapolytechnic.ca/~john.sellens/unx511/references/IntroToLinux.pdf).
  - **2007–2008**: Linux became the foundation of the Android operating system, propelling it to global dominance in mobile markets.
    

**How Linux Became a Complete Operating System**
  - Linux evolved into a fully functional operating system through the integration of key components and the contributions of a thriving community:
    - **Kernel**: At its core, Linux serves as the OS kernel, responsible for managing system hardware, process scheduling, memory, and devices.
    - **GNU Tools**: Programs such as the `bash` shell, compilers (e.g., `gcc`), and essential utilities provided the foundational user space, enabling interaction with the kernel.
    - **Distributions**: Linux distributions, like Ubuntu, Fedora, and CentOS, bundle the kernel with GNU tools, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), package managers, and other software to create user friendly and complete systems.
    - **Industry and Community**: A global community of developers and corporate backing from companies like IBM, Intel, and Red Hat played vital roles in fostering Linux's development, innovation, and widespread adoption [[5]](https://www.systemtek.co.uk/2024/12/the-history-of-linux-from-hobby-project-to-global-phenomenon).


**Technical Characteristics of Linux**
  - Modular Monolithic Kernel: Combines monolithic performance and modular extensibility.
  - POSIX Compliance: Enables compatibility with Unix like applications.
  - Advanced Filesystems: Offers EXT3, EXT4, XFS, Btrfs, and more.
  - Security: Features SELinux and namespaces for isolation.
  - Containerization: Pioneered technologies like cgroups, Docker, and Kubernetes.


**Linux Development Model**
  1. Open collaboration via mailing lists and Git repositories.
  2. Maintainer model: Senior developers oversee kernel subsystems.
  3. Licensing under GPL v2 to enforce open-source sharing.


**Why Linux Succeeded?**
  1. **Freedom**: Open source permissiveness led to broad adoption.
  2. **Versatility**: Scales from embedded devices to supercomputers.
  3. **Community/Business Partnerships**: Corporations (e.g., IBM, Intel, Red Hat) played vital roles.
  4. **Networking Strengths**: Linux dominates the cloud and server markets [[3]](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/linux-from-the-beginning-history-and-evolution/).


**Linux Clarifications**
  - Linux is a kernel, not a full OS. Distributions add GNU tools, package managers, and UI/desktop environments to complete the system.
  - Linux is Unix like, not Unix. Although Linux mimics Unix functionality, it is independently written, containing no AT&T Unix code.
  - Community and licensing shaped Linux’s growth. GPL licensing ensured every enhancement remained open and that collaboration across institutions thrived.

**Core principles of the Unix/Linux Philosophy**
  - The Unix/Linux philosophy is built around a set of timeless principles that prioritise simplicity, modularity, and interconnectivity. These principles have shaped the design of tools and systems, ensuring their flexibility, reliability, and ease of use. Key principles include:

    - Do One Thing and Do It Well:
      - Programs should focus on performing a single task with excellence, avoiding feature bloat and excessive generalisation.

    - Connect Programs:
      - Design programs to work together, allowing the power of the system to emerge from how tools are combined. Features like pipelines (`|`) make it easy to connect programs into sophisticated workflows.

    - Use Plain Text for Interface:
      - Programs should communicate using plain text streams. This approach provides a portable, universal, and human readable interface, and aligns with the Unix principle of treating most system resources (devices, processes, etc.) as files.

    - Simplicity Over Complexity:
      - Emphasise simple, elegant designs over unnecessarily complex ones. Complexity should be introduced only when necessary, ensuring programs remain maintainable and understandable.

    - Graceful Error Handling:
      - Programs should handle errors as clearly and predictably as possible, enabling users or subsequent tools in a pipeline to respond appropriately.  

By adhering to these principles, Unix/Linux systems achieve a harmonious balance of functionality, modularity, and efficiency, making them enduring and adaptable to ever-changing technological landscapes.

**Linux Distributions**

A Linux distribution (distro) is an operating system made from a software collection that includes the Linux kernel and a package management system.

**Categories of Linux Distributions**
  - Linux distributions can be broadly classified into two categories:

1. **Community (Enthusiast) Distributions**:
   - These are maintained by the community of developers and users.
   - They often have a fast update cycle, providing the latest software versions.
   - Examples: Fedora, openSUSE Tumbleweed, Arch Linux, Debian (to some extent).
   - They may not be suitable for enterprise environments due to the potential for breaking changes and lack of long term support.

2. **Enterprise Distributions**:
   - These are designed for stability and long-term support, making them suitable for business critical environments.
   - They offer enterprise grade support, often for extended periods (5-13 years).
   - Examples: Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), Ubuntu Server.
   - They are typically backed by commercial entities that provide paid support, training, and certification.


**Long Term Support (LTS)**

Some Linux distributions, particularly enterprise ones and some community ones (like Ubuntu), offer Long Term Support (LTS) versions. These versions are supported with security updates and bug fixes for a longer period, typically 5 years or more, as opposed to non-LTS versions which may be supported for only a few months to two years.

**Cost of Linux**

While the Linux distribution itself is usually free to download and use, enterprise distributions often require a paid subscription for support, maintenance, and additional management tools. The total cost of ownership (TCO) may be lower than proprietary alternatives, but organizations must consider their internal capabilities and the value of professional support.

**Interface**
  - Linux can be used via:
    - **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: User friendly desktop environments (e.g., GNOME, KDE, XFCE) that allow point-and-click interactions.
    - **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: A text based interface where users type commands to perform tasks. The CLI is powerful and often preferred by system administrators and developers for its efficiency and scriptability.

**Red Hat and RPM**
  - Red Hat, founded in 1993, popularized the use of the **RPM Package Manager** (RPM) for managing software. Over time, Red Hat shifted its focus to the enterprise market with **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)**, a stable, supported distribution with a long release cycle, available under a paid subscription.
  - The community driven **Fedora** project serves as the upstream for RHEL, where new features are tested and integrated before being incorporated into RHEL. Additionally, **CentOS** (Community Enterprise Operating System) was a free, community supported distribution derived from RHEL source code, but it has since shifted to a different model (CentOS Stream) which is the upstream development branch for RHEL.
