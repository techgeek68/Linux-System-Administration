## Aliases

  - Aliases are custom shortcuts for commands or command sequences.
  - They simplify the command line experience by making frequently used commands easier to remember and execute.
  - Aliases are defined in shell configuration files and are user specific by default.

> The most commonly used shell in Linux is the Bash shell (Bourne Again Shell). Aliases described in this document apply specifically to Bash, though similar concepts exist in other shells.

**1. Temporary Aliases**

Temporary aliases exist only for the current terminal session and are lost when the session ends.

Syntax:
```bash
alias alias_name='command'
```

Example:
```bash
alias ls='ls -l'
```
After creating this alias, typing `ls` executes `ls -l`.

**2. Permanent Aliases**

Permanent aliases persist across sessions by being stored in configuration files.

**For a Current User**

User specific aliases are stored in `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.bash_aliases` if it exists and is sourced by `.bashrc`).

1. Open your user's `.bashrc` file:
   ```bash
   vi ~/.bashrc
   ```
   (You can use any text editor like `nano` or `gedit`.)

2. Add alias definitions, typically at the end of the file:
   ```bash
   alias ls='ls -l'
   alias rm='rm -i'  # Prompts before removal
   ```

3. Save and exit the editor.

4. Apply changes immediately without logging out:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

**System Wide Aliases**

System wide aliases affect all users and are defined in `/etc/bashrc` (RHEL/CentOS/Fedora) or `/etc/bash.bashrc` (Debian/Ubuntu).


1. Switch to the root user or use `sudo`:
   ```bash
   su - root
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   sudo vi /etc/bashrc
   ```

2. Open the system configuration file:
   ```bash
   vi /etc/bashrc
   ```

3. Add alias definitions at the end of the file:
   ```bash
   alias c='clear'
   ```

4. Save and exit.

5. Apply changes:
   ```bash
   source /etc/bashrc
   ```

**Managing Aliases**

Viewing Existing Aliases

To list all aliases defined in the current session:
```bash
alias
```

Removing Aliases

To remove an alias from the current session:
```bash
unalias alias_name
```

Example:
```bash
unalias ls
```

To permanently remove an alias, delete or comment out its definition from the configuration file (`~/.bashrc` or `/etc/bashrc`) and reload the file.

**Considerations**:

  1. **Session Specificity**: Aliases are specific to the shell in which they're defined. Starting a new terminal session or switching to a different shell requires redefining aliases unless they're stored in appropriate configuration files.

  2. **Command Conflicts**: Choose alias names carefully to avoid overriding existing commands or system utilities. For example, avoid creating an alias named `ls` that changes its default behavior drastically.

  3. **Portability**: While aliases enhance personal workflow, relying heavily on custom aliases may reduce efficiency when working on systems where they aren't defined.

  4. **Limitations**: Aliases are best for simple command substitutions. For complex logic or scripting, consider using shell functions or scripts instead.

  5. **Alternative Locations**: Some distributions may use `~/.bash_aliases` for user specific aliases. This file is typically sourced from `~/.bashrc` if it exists.
